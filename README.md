This landing page clone was created with the help of a design provided to me and further customized to suit my interests. The page is inspired by my favorite esports organization, 100 Thieves, and serves to promote the 100 Thieves apparel line.

While creating this project, I refreshed my knowledge of HTML and CSS basics while taking care to specifically utilize my recently learned knowledge of flexbox.
